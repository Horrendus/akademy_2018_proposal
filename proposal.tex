\section*{Summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Summary}
Reading the Call for Hosts for Akademy 2018 was great, published a long time before the conference should happen.
In informal talks, we found together as organizers and started to gather ideas and worked on creating this proposal for organizing Akademy 2018 in Vienna.

\subsection*{Community}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Community}
The Austrian KDE community is still very small compared to many other cities. At the Akademy 2014 in Brno, we had a KDE Austria BoF and created the kde-at Mailinglist.
Since then we've met up a few times and now want to organize Akademy 2018. We believe Vienna can get together a big number of KDE supporters from all over the world
due to it's central location in the heart of Europe. Also due to the proposed venue at the Technical University of Vienna, Akademy can reach over 5000 talented computer science students.

\subsection*{Date}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Date}
Since the proposed venue is a university campus, Akademy should take
place during the summer break which starts at the beginning of July and
ends at the end of September.

\subsection*{Local Support}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Local Support}
KDE has many supporters and contributors in Central and Eastern \mbox{Europe}.
Akademy 2018 in Viena will be a great opportunity
for KDE to grow the community even more.

Brno has a strong and lively
Free Software community. Many talented students who are interested in
Linux technologies might get interested in KDE and our software. The
university, where the conference will take place, has several research
projects in the field of computer graphics and desktop. Also the very
active Openmobility group which associates people interested in open
mobile technologies operates from here. Brno's Linux community is
organized in the "Linux in Brno" group that supports the idea of
\mbox{Akademy} in Brno.

\item \emph{Hotel Avanti} $\star\star\star\star{}$ -- is another mid-range option we recommend. One
double bed room is CZK\,1,690 (\euro{69}) for one person and CZK\,1,840
(\euro{75} for two persons). The hotel also offers more expensive
options up to a President suite for CZK\,4,890 (\euro{200}). It might be possible
to arrange a discount for Akademy attendees. The hotel is 15
minutes (tram), 25 minutes (walking) from the conference venue. And it's
just 12 minutes by tram to get to the city center. The hotel's website:
