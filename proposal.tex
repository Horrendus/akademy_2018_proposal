\section*{Summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Summary}
Reading the Call for Hosts for Akademy 2018 was great, published a long time before the conference should happen.
In informal talks, we found together as organizers and started to gather ideas and worked on creating this proposal for organizing Akademy 2018 in Vienna.

\subsection*{Community}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Community}
The Austrian KDE community is still very small compared to many other cities. At the Akademy 2014 in Brno, we had a KDE Austria BoF and created the kde-at Mailinglist.
Since then we've met up a few times and now want to organize Akademy 2018. We believe Vienna can get together a big number of KDE supporters from all over the world
due to it's central location in the heart of Europe. Also due to the proposed venue at the Technical University of Vienna, Akademy can reach over 5000 talented computer science students.

\subsection*{Date}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Date}
Since the proposed venue is a university campus, Akademy should take
place during the summer break which starts at the beginning of July and
ends at the end of September.

\subsection*{Local Support}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Local Support}
KDE has many supporters and contributors in Central and Eastern \mbox{Europe}.
Akademy 2018 in Viena will be a great opportunity
for KDE to grow the community even more.

\newpage

\subsection*{Organizing Team}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Organizing Team}
People from Vienna who have been working on the proposal
and expressed their willingness to help organize the conference.

\subsubsection*{Stefan Derkits}

\subsubsection*{Joseph Wenninger}

\subsubsection*{Lukas Hetzenecker}

\subsubsection*{Jan Vales}



\subsubsection*{Elisabeth Hafner}

\vspace{10pt}
\noindent More people have already promised to help in later phases of organizing.

\subsection*{Local Support Groups}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Local Support Groups}

Good contacts to the following groups exist and those can be used for additional volunteers or sponsorship.

\subsubsection*{Fachschaft Informatik}

Fachschaft Informatik (FSINF) is a group representing the student council for computer science students at the Technical University of Vienna.
They can reserver lecture halls for free and thus would provide the rooms needed for Akademy free of charge.
Additionally they are able to sponsor a small amount of money (up to 300 \euro{}, usable for e.g. food/non-alcoholic drinks/cleaning personal).
Also they have good contacts to the faculty, which may lead to more support \& visibility for Akademy 2018.

\subsubsection*{HTU Wien}

HTU Wien represents all students at the Technical University of Vienna. They support special projects with up to 500 \euro{} (same criteria as Fachschaft Informatik) and can help with organizational tasks regarding the venue. Also their contacts to other student councils (e.g. Electrical Engineering, Mathematics \& Physics) is valuable in promoting Akademy 2018 at Technical University to students who don't study computer science.

\subsubsection*{Metalab}

Metalab is a non-profit hackerspace in Vienna. Apart from people working there on realizing different projects, it is a meeting place for a diverse range of user groups (e.g. UX Design user group, Debian user group Vienna \& Python user group Austria). They are also the home base of the C3W (Chaos Computer Club Wien).


\subsection*{Previously organized events}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Previously organized events}
In the past we already organized events ranging from around 5 up to 200 people. Not all of them were FOSS or IT related, but netherless show our organizing skills.

It is located a bit outside of the City. Trains to the city center run every 15 minutes, take 25 minutes to reach Vienna and cost 4 \euro{}.\\
Some low-cost airlines (e.g. RyanAir \& WizzAir) don't fly to VIE directly but to either Bratislava, Brno or Budapest.

\section*{The Venue}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{The Venue}
The proposed Venue would be the Technical University of Vienna (TU Wien). TU Wien consists of over 10 indivdual buildings, with most of them clustered in the area around Karlsplatz. Out of those buildings, two would fit for Akademy. They are in 5 minutes walking distance, so having the conference days at one and the BoFs at the other would be an option. The location has good public transport connection (see section ''How To Get Around'').\\
Fachschaft Informatik would reserve the necessary rooms, so there would be no reservation fee for them.

\subsection*{Neues EI}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Neues EI}

Neues EI (''new electrical-engineering institute'') is a recently renovated building located 10 minutes walking from the subway station Karlsplatz and 5 minutes walking from the subway station Taubstummengasse. Apart from four big lecture rooms on the ground floor, there is a big aula in the building and two areas with computers, that could be used as hacking areas. For the conference it would be the preferred location due to the simple building layout and easy to find rooms. Also it is more representative than Freihaus.

\vspace{10pt}

Conference \& General Assembly rooms:
\begin{description}
\item[\color{kdedarker} EI7] -- 434 seats, one of the biggest \& most representative lecture rooms at TU Wien.
\item[\color{kdedarker} EI8] -- 139 seats, a lecture room located next to EI7.
\item[\color{kdedarker} EI9] -- 181 seats, a lecture room located around the corner of EI7.
\item[\color{kdedarker} EI10]-- 375 seats, a lecutre room located next to EI9.

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{EI7_tuwien.jpg}
	\footnotesize{EI7 (Source: TU Wien)}
\end{center}
\vspace{10pt}

For the BoFs, the following rooms could be used:\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item The 4 lecture rooms from above
	\item An additional lecutre room in the 3rd floor
	\item Up to 8 seminar rooms on the 2nd to 4th floor
\end{itemize}

Due to the scattered seminar rooms, the other location would be a better fit for the BoFs.

\subsubsection*{Equipment}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Equipment}
All lecture \& seminar rooms are equipped with:
\begin{itemize}
	\item a projector,
	\item a cable to connect a laptop to the projector,
	\item audio (hands-free microphones),
	\item video and audio recording,
	\item wifi connection (encrypted, guest accounts would need to be organized)

The entire building is covered by a wireless network.

Brno offers good venues to organize conference parties. Some of them are
really close to the proposed conference venue. Here are some we propose
because we've already organized social events there and have good
experience with them:

\begin{description}
\item[\color{kdedarker} Fléda] -- a large venue for concerts and other events which is located
30 minutes walk from the conference venue. It has capacity up to 800 people.
The rent for one night is CZK\,31,700 (\euro{1,230}) and can provide discount
on catering. Fléda website: \url{http://www.fleda.cz}
\item[\color{kdedarker} Semilasso] -- venue for concerts and other events which is
just a few hundred meters from the conference venue. The main hall
has capacity 700 people, the garden 300 people. The rent for one night
is CZK\,35,000 (\euro{1,355}). The club is also suitable for concerts,
both outside and inside. The club's website:
\url{http://www.semilasso.cz/}
\item[\color{kdedarker} Brewery Brno] -- a large restaurant located on the premises of
Brno's brewery. The capacity of the main hall is at least 300 people.
It has a dance floor and a DJ can be arranged. A~rent for one night is
CZK\,90,000 (\euro{3,673}). The rent is free if you order catering. The

We'd like to provide several price levels of accommodation to suit to all conference attendants:

\subsection*{Low Cost}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Low Cost}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Student Dormitories} of the Mendel University in Brno -- 
are the cheapest accommodation option. They can provide a
large number of rooms. The current price is CZK\,600 (\euro{23.3}) for a
double-bed room and CZK\,400 (\euro{15.5}) for single-bed room. Breakfast is additional
CZK\,110 (\euro{4.3}). The dormitories have facilities
such as a student cafeteria, pizzeria, sport facilities, and even a
cinema. The campus is just 3~bus stops away from the venue and the bus
53 takes you almost from door to door. If you feel like stretching your
legs a bit the pleasent walk will take you about 15 -- 20 minutes. A~tram
takes you to the old town in about 20 minutes.

options up to a President suite for CZK\,4,890 (\euro{200}). It might be possible
